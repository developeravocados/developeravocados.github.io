## Why Developer Avocados ðŸ¥‘ _Weekly_?

We've always thought there's not enough Developer Avocados out there, and we wanted to help change that. When we started out, we used to read [Technically Speaking](https://techspeak.email/) a lot, but Cate and Chiu-Ki took a break. We've waited this past year for someone to pick up the slack and come up with a replacement. Turns out, it's us ðŸ˜…! We want to keep a similar minimalist format, with a few highly curated resources and a few good conference CFPs. Delivered every  week in your inbox. But we are changing the focus from strictly public  speaking. Our resources and tips geared towards helping you become a (better) Developer Avocado ðŸ¥‘!

So Developer Avocados ðŸ¥‘ Weekly is a curated list of articles, resources and CFPs. It saves you time and all the <abbr aria-label="Fear of Missing Out">FOMO</abbr>. ðŸ’Œ You could just read the [archive](https://developeravocados.substack.com), but we feel this weekly email in your inbox is going to keep reminding you there is a world of avocados out there, just like you, so please subscribe ðŸ’š. We'd appreciate you spreading the word on social media if you like what you see.
